NPS-FutureCraft
🚀 Overview

NPS-FutureCraft is a gamified retirement planning platform designed to transform National Pension System (NPS) savings from a “deferred responsibility” into an engaging, action-driven experience.

Instead of displaying static pension projections, NPS-FutureCraft simulates the user’s financial future using behavioral design, predictive analytics, and interactive visualization. The platform bridges the gap between “I should save” and “I am saving.”

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional pension tools:

Show static projections

Use fixed return assumptions

Overwhelm users with large target numbers

Lack engagement

As a result, many young users delay retirement planning despite knowing its importance.

💡 Our Solution

NPS-FutureCraft combines:

🎮 Gamification

📊 Probabilistic Financial Modeling

🧠 Behavioral Psychology

🔊 Multilingual AI Assistance

This creates a unified ecosystem that motivates consistent financial action.

🔥 Core Features
1️⃣ Digital Twin Retirement Simulator

Users create a virtual “Digital Twin” avatar representing their financial future.

When users:

Increase monthly contribution

Start investing early

Adjust retirement age

They instantly see lifestyle upgrades such as:

Rented apartment → Owned house

Basic car → Luxury vehicle

Standard lifestyle → Premium retirement

This makes compounding visually engaging instead of abstract.

2️⃣ Behavioral Bridge Mechanism

Unlike generic financial games, our system directly connects:

Real Pension Inputs ➝ Financial Engine ➝ Avatar Growth

Users must interact with real pension calculations to unlock in-app rewards.

This ensures:

Engagement leads to informed action

Game progress reflects real financial decisions

3️⃣ Probabilistic Wealth Projection Engine

Instead of fixed return assumptions (e.g., “10% every year”), we use:

✔ Monte Carlo simulations
✔ 1,000+ simulated market scenarios
✔ Range-based wealth outcomes

Example Output:
₹3 Crore – ₹5 Crore (Projected Range)

Benefits:

Transparent risk representation

No misleading guarantees

Builds long-term trust

Aligned with regulatory standards under the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA)

4️⃣ Life Stage Progression System

To prevent gamification fatigue, the app evolves with the user:

Level 1 – First Job
Level 2 – Marriage
Level 3 – Child Education
Level 4 – Home Loan
Level 5 – Pre-Retirement

This keeps engagement relevant across life events.

5️⃣ Multilingual AI Voice Assistant
